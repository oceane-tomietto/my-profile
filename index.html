			<h1>Hi, I’m Océane</h1>

			<h2>Music 🎼</h2>
			<p>
				I love music. I have been playing the piano for 11 years now and I am learning the guitar by myself with a friend's instrument. In my family, we all play music. As my brother plays the flute, my cousin of the violin, and my uncle of the banjo, we celebrate Christmas in music.

			<h2>Travels 🌏</h2>
			<p>
				I've traveled a lot and I love it. My parents gave me that passion. I have travelled a lot around Asia. One of my favorite trips was Vietnam. I have also been to the islands where I loved French Polynesia. My most memorable trip was a trip that I made alone. In July 2018, I went on a humanitarian trip to Mongolia.Immersed in nomadic life, I helped with the daily chores: cooking, taking care of the children, bringing back the herds (yaks, goats) on horseback, making cheese.

			<h2>Gymnastics 🏆</h2>
			<p>
				I've been doing gymnastics for seven years. Unfortunately, I had to stop when I moved to Lille.  So I competed in many individual and team competitions.  My favourite apparatus is the beam because it is an apparatus that requires discipline and mastery. I'm afraid of the vault even if it's an irrational fear. I was in the gym a lot last year, I was also a coach in my club for 2 years. I was coaching a group of 12 little girls between the ages of 6 and 9. It was a great experience.
